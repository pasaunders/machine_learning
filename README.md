Using the data here:

I determined the median and average home price by suburb.
Then I created scatter plots showing the relationship between:
1) crime rate and pupil-teacher ration
2) the relationship between race and commute length
3) the relationship between nitric oxide concentration and home value
4) the realationship between crime rate and indsustiral zoning.
