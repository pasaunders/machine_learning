Data analysis:
Using the data here:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing

I determined the median and average home price by suburb.
Then I created scatter plots showing the relationship between:
1) crime rate and pupil-teacher ration
2) the relationship between race and commute length
3) the relationship between nitric oxide concentration and home value
4) the realationship between crime rate and indsustiral zoning.

Imperfect Data:
Using the data here:
https://data.seattle.gov/Transportation/Traffic-Flow-Counts/7svg-ds5z

The dataset describes trafic levels along different major corridors
in seattle and notes whether each measurment is downtown or not.
I chose this data because traffic flow data should be
personally useful.

Missing data is replaced by the modal value in it's column.
